Event-Schedule

Event::Schedule is a very simple module to manage a scheduled queue
of events for use in interactive programs such as IRC bots.
Events are added to the queue in the form of closures, then a clock
tick is called periodically.  Events whose time has elapsed are
called, then deleted from the schedule.
